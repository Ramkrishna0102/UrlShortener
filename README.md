#URL Shortener
A simple URL shortener service built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js/Express (or your backend of choice) for the backend. This application allows users to shorten long URLs and access them via a shorter, user-friendly version.

Features
Shorten long URLs to a compact format.

Redirect to the original URL when the shortened URL is visited.

Track the number of visits to each shortened URL.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js/Express (or your preferred backend stack)

Database: MongoDB (or your preferred database for storing URLs)

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (or yarn for package management)

Download Node.js from here.

MongoDB (or any other database of your choice) if applicable.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server

The backend server will be running at http://localhost:5000 (or the port you've configured).

Connecting Frontend and Backend
Ensure that the frontend is making requests to the correct backend URL.

Update API requests in your React app (e.g., in client/src/api.js) to match the backend server URL (usually http://localhost:5000 or any hosted URL).

Enter a long URL in the input field and click the "Shorten" button.

The app will generate a shortened URL and display it.

You can click on the shortened URL to be redirected to the original URL.
